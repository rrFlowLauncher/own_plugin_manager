# own_plugin_manager
This is a Plugin Manager for [FlowLauncher](https://www.flowlauncher.com).

There is an official [PluginManager](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.PluginsManifest) available.

# Why this project?
With this Plugin, you can `install` / `update` / `uninstall` Flow Launcher Plugins by your own.
The only thing, that you need, is to have the URL to the GitHub repo of the Plugin.

In the Officizial [Plugin Manifest](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.PluginsManifest),
you have to create a fork + Pull Request for your Plugins.
After that you have to wait, until someone reviewed your changes.
For every update of your Plugin, you have to do this again.
This need some more work and time to wait until your Plugin is available in FlowLauncher.

## What's the advantages of this Plugin
- You can install every Plugin, only with a GitHub Repo Link.
- You don't need to update the official Plugin Manifest file.
- You have not to wait, until someone is approved your changes in the Official Plugin Manifest.
- If the Plugin `Version` will be updated in the `plugin.json` file, you update it with this plugin, without anymore effort.
